       <p class="column">Mind reading technology brings a lot of promise towards gaming, entertainment, and medicine. This mind reading technology makes gaming a lot more fun because you have to use your brain most of the time. You donâ€™t have to use joysticks or a controller to play them.</p>

       <p class="column">The technology is detecting the intentions of your brain and not the actual movement. Then there's a better side of this mind reading technology.  People can use this to see other people's thoughts.  For the people who are mute they can read the thoughts of that person and see what they need.  Instead of making hand signals they can see their intentions or see what they need specifically.</p>
