        <h2>Mind Reading Technology ... Ya Scared?</h2>
         <img src="images/DR.jpg" alt="Dr. Oct">
        <p>Mind reading technology can make you move objects with your mind alone.<p>Not just objects but digital things also.</p><p>Mind reading technology is kinda like the octopus arms that Dr. Octavious created from Spider-Man.</p>
        <img src="images/gamer.jpg" alt="gamer"> 
        <p>Mind reading technology brings a lot of promise towards gaming, entertainment, and medicine. <p>This mind reading technology makes gaming a lot more fun because you have to use your brain most of the time.</p> <p>You donâ€™t have to use joysticks or a controller to play them.</p>

       <img src="images/thoughts.jpg" alt="thinking">
      <p> The technology is detecting the intentions of and not the actual movement.<p> Then there's a better side of this mind reading technology.</p> <p> People can use this to see other people's thoughts. </p> <p>For the people who are mute they can read the thoughts of that person and see what they need. </p> <p>Instead of making hand signals they can see their intentions or see what they need specifically.</p>
