    <h1>How Does This Mind Reading Tech Work?</h1>

    <p>Mind reading technology is technology that allows our thoughts and feelings to be translated into a digital form. Sensors are put on your scalp and they are translated into digital signals. The mind reading technology analyzes your vision in your brain and people can know what you want to act upon. Then they modify that thought and it creates a command, doing what you are thinking about or intending to do. Commands are created and then all you have to do is have the intentions of pressing that button with your brain then the action will happen. With this you can control many things by doing no physical actions.</p>

    <p>The mind reading technology can help people that are mute. When they have to say something they can just use the mind reading technology and show others their thoughts and intentions so they won’t have to use hand signals. This mind reading technology can also help out the people who have amelia. Amelia is a birth defect where at birth you lack one or more limbs. People who have amelia can use this mind reading technology to help them with their everyday life. So this is like having a prosthetic arm.  For example if people who have amelia or something like amelia and they want to do something physical like changing the channel, they can use the mind reading device to change the channel or turn up or down the volume.</p>

    <p>The mind reading technology runs on your emotions. It uses sensors to see what your thoughts are. With those thoughts, the mind reading technology does the action that you are thinking about. There are times in life where people have bad intentions but do not want to act on those intentions. With mind reading technology you may think of those intentions and they will do that action. That is what makes mind reading technology dangerous. People can doze off into something like that and they will be a threat to everyone else.</p>
